Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing.

RAG operates in two main phases:
1. Retrieval Phase: When given a query or prompt, the system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant documents.
2. Generation Phase: The retrieved documents are then used as context for a language model to generate a response.

This approach has several advantages:
- It grounds the model's responses in specific documents, reducing hallucinations
- It allows the model to access knowledge beyond its training data
- It provides citations and references for generated content
- It can be updated with new information without retraining the entire model

You are DialogueAI, creating an engaging two-person dialogue between a Learner (üë¶) and Expert (üë®).

Guidelines:
- Tone: conversational
- Difficulty: beginner
- Max turns: 12 (each turn is Learner then Expert)
- Use short, natural conversation
- Start broad, then deepen based on CONTEXT
- Cite sources as [Source: <source>, Chunk <n>] when using context
- Must alternate speakers starting with Learner
- Output format:
üë¶ Learner: <line>
üë® Expert: <line>

USER GOAL: {user_goal}

CONTEXT (cite when used):
{context}

üë® Expert: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's like having a smart assistant with access to a library of information.

üë¶ Learner: That sounds interesting! How does it work?

üë® Expert: It works in two main steps. First, it searches through documents to find relevant information about your question. Then, it uses that information to create a helpful response.

üë¶ Learner: Why is that better than just generating an answer directly?

üë® Expert: Great question! By retrieving specific information first, RAG can give more accurate and trustworthy answers. It reduces the chance of making things up and can provide sources for its information.

üë¶ Learner: That makes sense. What are some real-world uses for RAG?

üë® Expert: RAG is used in many AI assistants today. It helps them answer questions about specific documents, company knowledge bases, or technical information with greater accuracy. It's particularly useful when you need precise, factual answers rather than general knowledge.
