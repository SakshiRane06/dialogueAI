ðŸ‘¦ Learner: I'd like to understand Explain like podcast better. Can you explain what it is?

ðŸ‘¨ Expert: Great question! If the criteria is met,
then the contract registers the order to the protocol's core ledger;
4) After the registration is successful, the protocol contract broadcasts the order registration message,
returning the result;
5) Market A business protocol contract returns the final result to Alice.
Transaction:
1) Market B obtains all transactions by synchronizing with the blockchain.

broadcast on the P2P network.
9) Generating the final signature of a new block:
a) After the last round of byzantine election, nodes will update the algorithm step, and assess whether
any of them should cooperate in creating the final signature of a new block.
b) If a node has evaluated that it should cooperate in creating the final signature, it executes the
following steps:
i)
According to the vote count, assesses whether the block proposal has reached a quorum-
backed consensus.
ii) If no quorum-backed consensus is reached, sets the consensus result of the new block to
be false.
iii) Packs the polling message on the basis of the former assessment and signs it.
iv) Broadcasts the final block hash as well as the signature of the polling result to the P2P
network.

Transaction:
1) Market B obtains all transactions by synchronizing with the blockchain.
2) Market B obtains the order registration message broadcast by market A through the transaction in the
executed block.
3) The order information in the order registration message is displayed in Market B.
4) Bob initiates the transaction to Market B for the order that Alice registered above;
5) Market B checks Bob's transaction request and according to the classification, the protocol initiates the
transaction.
6) The protocol contract inspects market B's permissions and transaction request information [Source: fc59f438-096f-4ccb-bdb1-71e6187b9a49_Ontology-technology-white-paper-EN.pdf, Chunk 73]

ðŸ‘¦ Learner: That's helpful! Can you tell me more about the key concepts?

ðŸ‘¨ Expert: Absolutely! The main concepts to understand are Nodes, Figure, Packs. These are fundamental to grasping how everything works together.

ðŸ‘¦ Learner: What makes this approach so valuable? What are the main advantages?

ðŸ‘¨ Expert: Great question! This can greatly reduce the storage pressure on each node since the chain does not save the actual transaction content. This contract model enables dApps to share their data with each other using generic protocols, despite their business [Source: fc59f438-096f-4ccb-bdb1-71e6187b9a49_Ontology-technology-white-paper-EN.pdf, Chunk 73]

ðŸ‘¦ Learner: Are there any challenges or limitations I should be aware of?

ðŸ‘¨ Expert: That's a thoughtful question. It also makes collaboration across boundaries much easier. The process of order registration and exchange is shown in figure 5.4. Figure 5.4: Data Exchange Process Registration:  ---  [Source: fc59f438-096f-4ccb-bdb1-71e6187b9a49_Ontology-technology-white-paper-EN.pdf, Chunk 123] two-party computation protocol was introduced by Andrew Yao, which can be used to solve Yao's Millionaires' Problem: two millionaires who are interested in knowing who is richer without letting the other know their actual wealth It's important to understand both the strengths and limitations.

ðŸ‘¦ Learner: This has been really enlightening! What would you recommend as next steps for learning more?

ðŸ‘¨ Expert: I'm glad this was helpful! I'd suggest diving deeper into the specific areas that interest you most, and don't hesitate to explore the source material for additional details.
